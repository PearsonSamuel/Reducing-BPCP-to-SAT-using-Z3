# Reducing-BPCP-to-SAT-using-Z3
Reducing the Bounded Post Correspondence Problem to SAT and using Z3's python interface to solve the SAT instance.

Given two lists of strings U and V and a bound k, the program will return a solution if one is found, and 'unsat' otherwise.

This work is essentially an implementation of the ideas presented in:
